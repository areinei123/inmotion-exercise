Coding challenge for InMotion Software

Initialized project with express-generator. I am using the guide 
[here](https://mherman.org/blog/designing-a-restful-api-with-node-and-postgres/)
to get started with a simple backend.

To get started:

Clone a copy locally

run `npm install` to load the node modules

run `psql -f movies.sql`

start the services with `npm run dev`

Now you have a backend express service running on port 8080 and a frontend react app on port 8888
